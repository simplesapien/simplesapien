## About me :writing_hand:

Hey there! I'm Kevan, a **fledgling web developer**. I'm a largely self-taught programmer who loves to create powerful scripts in JavaScript to simplify everyday life.

## Profile layout

I have all my coursework and projects for school separated into their own "organizations" on the left-hand side, so feel free to take a look! Any project that could be hosted on Pages, will be. 

On my main page, I'll be adding personal projects that I've worked on that I found either fun or interesting. All code shared is **100%** free to use or expand upon.
